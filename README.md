# DockerScripts
This repository contains several bash scripts that I use to run and control dockers
- **rl_start.sh** and **tf_start.sh**: start a docker image with all common options including port mapping, password, and directory mount
- **execBashDocker.sh**: open bash shell on a running docker process
- **cleanDocker.sh**: clean temporary docker files
